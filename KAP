to create epic 
    -> new item 
    -> tracker(epic)
    ->subject(add title here for an epic)
    ->description()
    -> assign to someone , start date , due date 
    -> can be edited

to create user story 
    ->new item
    -> tracker(user story)
    -> subject
    -> description
    -> assign 
    -> story point(to define complexity of ur user story)
    ->create 
to create a task 
    create it in the same way


# go to items to see ur  epic , userstory,  task 
# initially no relation exists  between these 3 
-> to add relation copy the item_id or a text and click on edit then go to  parent task and then paste that id for defining of  relation then SUBMIT 


# EPIC(Topmost hierarchy) -> userStory(child of Epic) -> Task(child of userStory)
why to have realtions ? 
bcz ur single epic gets divided into multiple user stories and ur single userstories get divided into multiple tasks and these tasks will get assigned to  respective team members 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROJECT BACKLOG AND SPRINT BACKLOG 

-> go to BACKLOG tab 
-> since we created a user story we will have a product backlog (As this userstory is not asssociated  with any sprint )
-> so on the downarrow button in the same tab go to "New sprint"
-> provide any valid name for sprint -> provide a start date and due date (standard time duration is 2 weeks)
-> after creating a sprint we need to add user story with it as well 
    -> 2 ways to do it 
        1) simply drag and drop . also u can create userStory in Backlog tab only using the downarrow button 
        2)

-> u can track progress of ur sprint using burndown chart 

-> goto releases tab and create a release .(as soon as a release s created it will be visible in the Backlogs tab)

# User story acts as centralised component where it is bound to have some relation with
Epic
Task
Sprint
Release

-> so we want to have relation with user story and release 
-> steps: 
    -> goto edit for userstory 
    -> go in releases dropdown and select ur release
